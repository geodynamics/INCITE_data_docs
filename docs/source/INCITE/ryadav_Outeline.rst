Simulations for geodynamo by Rakesh Yadav (Herverd University). Simulations are thermally driven magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulaiton in a rotating spherical shell modeled on the Earth's outer core. In the present simulations, the ratio of the inner to outer radii is set to 0.35, and spherical shell is filled by a electorically conductive fluid. The thermally driven convection is assumed with the Boussinesq approximation. Important parameters in the simulations are listed in the following table.
